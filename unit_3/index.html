  Welcome to my page!</p>
  <p> I started weaving when I moved to Austin from Philadelphia as a way to escape the Texas heat in the summer months. When friends and family continued to make requests, I realized that this casual hobby had the potential to turn into a small business. I love creating pieces for my customers. Hopefully one of these works of arts will find ahome in your living space!</p>
