  <p id="history">I started weaving when I moved to Austin from Philadelphia as a way to escape the Texas heat in the summer months. When friends and family continued to make requests, I realized that this casual hobby had the potential to turn into a small business. I love creating warm pieces for my customers and their homes. Hopefully one of my pieces will find a home in your living space!</p>
